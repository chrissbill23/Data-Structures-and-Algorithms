# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
My implementations in Python of some Data Structures and Algorithms.

##  Data structures implemented
* [Heaps](./DataStructure/Heap.py)
* [Queue](./DataStructure/Queue.py) with O(1) enqueue and O(1) dequeue operations
* [Graph](./DataStructure/Graph.py): Ajacency list and Object-pointers representation

## Algorithms implemented
### [Maths](./Algorithms/Maths.py)
* [Binomial coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient) O(n) in time, O(1) in space
* [Catalan numbers](https://brilliant.org/wiki/catalan-numbers/) O(n) in time and O(1) in space
### [Graph Algorithms](./Algorithms/GraphAlgorithms.py)
* [BFS (Breadth First Search traversal)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) : with callback on the traversed node.
