# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
My implementations in Python of some Data Structures and Algorithms.

##  Data structures implemented
* [Heaps](./Heap.py)
* [Queue](./Queue.py) with O(1) enqueue and O(1) dequeue operations
* [Graph](./Graph.py)

## Algorithms implemented
### [Maths](./Maths.py)
* [Binomial coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient) O(n) in time, O(1) in space
* [Catalan numbers](https://brilliant.org/wiki/catalan-numbers/) O(n) in time and O(1) in space
